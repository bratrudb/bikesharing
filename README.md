# Bike Share

## Overview
I analyzed a New York City Bikshare program and shared the results using Tableau.

## Results

The first visualization shows the total number of bike rides in the month of August in NYC. This provides some key information when looking at the following visualizations and tells us this program is very popular in NYC.

The next visualization is a gender breakdown. We can see a majority of our potential riders are male.

People typically checkout a Citi Bike for 10 to 30 minutes with very little usage above 1 hour. This means there will always be bikes available for the next riders.

While males use this program more than females, we see that that all riders no matter the gender typically stay within that 10 to 30 minute checkout range with males slightly more likely to check the bikes out longer.

Most of the checkouts occur in the morning and early evening.

We can see it is important to build up a subscriber base as it adds to the ease of checking out a bike and most of the users are current subscribers.

Commuting hours show the highest demand for bikes.

On the weekends, usage is typically evenly spread throughout the day but durring the work week we see many of our customers use the bikes during their commuting hours.

## Summary

The above analysis shows that this program is very popular in New York and can succeed in denser population centers where trip times on a bicycle are less than 30 minutes which makes it perfect for getting around town in Des Moines.

Above we can find which of our routes are the most popular to ensure we have a sufficient number of bikes available for the higher demand.

Additionally, we see our customers age tends to skew younger outside of Manhatten.
